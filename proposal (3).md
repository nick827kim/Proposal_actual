# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Date Night Suggestion APP

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Using the openAI APT and the Google Places API, I will be creating a webpage that will ask for certain inputs to generate resturant suggestions.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This web application, built using Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS, makes it easy for users to find the perfect restaurant for a date night based on their preferences. Users input their preferences through a series of prompts and a dropdown menu, which include details such as cuisine type, location, budget, and age group.

The app utilizes the OpenAI API to generate a list of recommended restaurants based on the users' inputs. Once the suggestions are generated, the Google Places API is used to fetch and display additional information about each restaurant, such as ratings and address.

By leveraging the power of Python, Flask, and APIs, this project provides an intuitive, user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of choosing the ideal restaurant for a date night.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I want to make the website and incorperate two API's anything less would be embarressing to me

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

It would be a fully fleshed out app/webapp that I am activly generating revenue from.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Monitization. A level 0 screen where users can deside if they want to plan a date night/ family night/ vacation. banner ads and possibly side ads on the right side of the screen. I would want to include several more applications I feel like only having a date night generater is pointless for a lot of people. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I want to get comfroatable building my own website while using AI to help me. I realize how much the job market is going to shrink and I need to beat that curve. I will need to research and learn how to use API's and how I can better prompt GPT to give me helpful suggestions along the way/
